But these same ideas return in the second year of the BA English degree with Representing Class: Stories and Conflict and in the third year with Bodies and Performances: Sex and Gender, and in this way students are able, if they choose, to fully develop their understanding of literary expression, representation and recognition across a broad range of literary texts",
